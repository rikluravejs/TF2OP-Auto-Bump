> What is it?
    TF2OP Auto Bump is a small application that auto-bumps your trades on Tf2outpost.

> How it works?
    Roughly every 30 minutes TF2OP Auto Bump opens your trade links in your default web 
    browser with "/bump" attached to bump them.
    Example: http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/111111XX/bump

> What do I have to do for it to work?
    Almost nothing. All you have to do is launch the application and input the links
    to your trades on Tf2outpost (see instructions below). Let it run for as long as
    you want your trades auto-bumped.

> Isn't it against Tf2outpost rules?
    Yes, it is.
    Point 5 under Tf2outpost trade rules: "No auto-bumping scripts — becoming a 
    donator is the only way to legitimately have autobumps."
    Visit http://www.tf2outpost.com/donate to become a donator.

> Will I get caught if I use it?
    Most likely not. To date no such cases have ever been reported. Use at your own risk.

> Is it safe (scamming, hijacking)?
    Yes, it is completely safe. TF2OP Auto Bump does not require any of your account
    information. The code is open source and can be inspected by anyone.
